Using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, analyze and visualize climate data as you prepare to open up a surf shop.

# Background/ Challenge 
W. Avy likes our analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Analysis
An analysis on O'ahu's weather could help determine whether seasons affect the surf and shake shop in the island. 
In this analysis, I compared June and December data to describe summer and winter temperatures. 
1. During this time period, both June and December had an average temperature of 75°F and and 71°F, respectively. 
2. June had a low temperature of 64°F and a high temperature of 85°F whereas December had a low temperature of 56°F and a high temperature of 83°F. 
3. Both June and December had very similar standard deviations. June's standard deviation of 3.26 and December's standard deviation of 3.75 
4. Lastly, June and December had a 75th percentile of 77°F and 74°F, respectively, which indicates that these two seasons had relatively warm temperatures.

# Additional analysis
1. Precipitation to observe quantity and frequency during June and December, and determine whether precipitation plays a factor despite the warm temperatures that are experienced during this time.
2. Data comparison on both temperature and precipitation during June and December, and determine whether these together will contribute to business.
